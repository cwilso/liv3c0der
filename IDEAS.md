## Ideas for sound

More effects. Effects as Instances that can be plugged.

## UI/General

Shortcuts for
* showing Help on various subjects
* showing the preset list (make it keyboard-navigatable?)
* showing a list of loaded samples and images (does ace have autocompletion?)

Import/Export. Loading stuff from remote, maybe.

Server component for file storage and multiple sessions (with local sync and offline stuff. How?)
